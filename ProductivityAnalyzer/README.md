## Remote Work Productivity Analyzer

## Description
Problem:
Remote workers often struggle with productivity due to distractions, poor work-life balance, and difficulty in tracking how their time is spent. These challenges can lead to inefficiency and stress.

Solution:
Create a desktop or web application that tracks and analyzes user activity to provide insights into productivity patterns. The application would monitor how much time is spent on various tasks (e.g., working on specific applications, browsing the web, idle time) and offer actionable suggestions to improve productivity. Key features could include:

## Features
Activity Tracking: The app logs time spent on different applications, websites, or tasks.
Productivity Reports: Users receive daily or weekly reports that summarize their activity, highlighting productive vs. unproductive time.
Focus Mode: A feature that blocks distracting apps or websites during work hours.
Goal Setting: Users can set daily or weekly productivity goals, and the app tracks progress toward those goals.
Data Visualization: Visual dashboards show time spent on various tasks, helping users identify patterns and areas for improvement.
Technologies:

## Technology
Backend: Python for activity tracking and data processing.
Frontend: If a desktop app, use Python with Tkinter or PyQt. For a web app, use JavaScript with a framework like React.
Database: SQLite for storing activity logs, user settings, and reports.
Data Visualization: Matplotlib or Plotly for generating graphs and charts within the app.
Why It’s Manageable Solo:
This project focuses on analyzing local data (from the user's device), which simplifies development as there’s no need for complex server-side infrastructure. You can start with a simple activity tracker and gradually add more sophisticated features like focus mode or goal setting.


## Folder/File Structure Recap:
tracker.py: Contains the logic for tracking activities and implementing features like Focus Mode.
database.py: Handles all database interactions.
reporting.py: Manages data visualization and reporting features.
ui.py: Manages the user interface.
